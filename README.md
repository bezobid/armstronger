An Armstrong number (also known as narcissistic number or pluperfect digital invariant) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Armstronger finds all Armstrong numbers in the range from 1 to 2147483647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE). This was one of the assignments I had during my Java Core training course. The algorithm takes around 400 ms and 25mb of memory to complete on my fairly modest machine. Bruteforce takes minutes.
